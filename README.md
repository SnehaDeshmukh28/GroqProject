# Project using Groq

## Overview

The GroqProject is designed to showcase the use of Groq systems and integrate machine learning models with data processing workflows. This project includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and a sample dataset for experimentation and testing.

## Features

- Email generation and processing using machine learning techniques.
- Testing and experimentation with ChromaDB for data storage and retrieval.
- Integration of portfolio data for personalized outputs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SnehaDeshmukh28/GroqProject.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GroqProject
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run Jupyter Notebooks:
   - Start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open notebooks from the `notebooks/` directory:
     - `email_generatorcode.ipynb`
     - `groq_test1.ipynb`
     - `test_chromadb.ipynb`

2. Work with CSV data:
   - Use `my_portfolio.csv` for analysis and integration.

3. Experiment with ChromaDB:
   - Use the `test_chromadb.ipynb` notebook for database operations.
